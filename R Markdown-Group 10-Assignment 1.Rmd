## Abstract

Technological progress in the world has unarguably improved the quality of life for the average person in many ways. The age of the automobile has shaped the way in which work, play and live our lives. Roadways, buildings, cities and entire countries have been designed to accommodate motor vehicles. As automobile technology has advanced making cars faster and capable of more advanced maneuvers, so has our concern with the safety of these vehicles. Entire disciplines such as traffic management are devoted to optimizing numerous factors to ensure the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. As we move into the age of data, all stakeholders in the automobile industry must effectively collect and utilize the wealth of information available to better meet their goals if progress is to continue. In this project, we take the position of a law enforcement agency, the New York City Police Department, as they seek to best utilize their resources in the context of responding to traffic collisions in the city.

## Background

At the end of 2017 in New York City, there were 1,923,041 cars registered to residents of the city. (https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/10/03/car-ownership-continues-to-rise-under-mayor-de-blasio/) This already-significant number does not include the heavy flow of vehicles of those who visit the city or are simply passing through. By contrast, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) budgets for a headcount of 35,822 uniformed officers (http://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2017/03/056-NYPD.pdf - page 4), distributed across 77 police precincts (geographic divisions of the city).  On-duty officers/traffic enforcement agents are allocated to each precinct to enforce traffic laws and handle emergency and administrative response to traffic incidents (such as collisions). NYC has been collecting traffic data, including specific data on vehicle collisions since 2014 to support “Vision Zero” , a traffic safety initiative which has the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities.

## Objective

The objective of our analysis is to develop a supervised, prediction model using Machine Learning techniques and the CRISP-DM framework (cite textbook) on the available collision data to predict whether there will be a collision in a specified police precinct at a specified time. The intent of predicting this data is to inform the NYPD’s optimal assignment of limited officers and resources across the 77 police precincts.

## Data Analysis

The data set that supports this analysis is sourced from the NYC Open Data project. The title of the data set is “Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes”. It contains entries for every collision recorded within New York City limits by NYPD agents beginning July 1st, 2012 up to the present day. There are approximately 1.65 million entries in the data set.

# DEFAULT R MARKDOWN CODE BELOW

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
