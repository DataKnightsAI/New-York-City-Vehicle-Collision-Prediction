\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Technological progress in the world has unarguably improved the quality
of life for the average person in many ways. The age of the automobile
has shaped the way in which work, play and live our lives. Roadways,
buildings, cities and entire countries have been designed to accommodate
motor vehicles. As automobile technology has advanced making cars faster
and capable of more advanced maneuvers, so has our concern with the
safety of these vehicles. Entire disciplines such as traffic management
are devoted to optimizing numerous factors to ensure the safe and
efficient movement of people and goods. As we move into the age of data,
all stakeholders in the automobile industry must effectively collect and
utilize the wealth of information available to better meet their goals
if progress is to continue. In this project, we take the position of a
law enforcement agency, the New York City Police Department, as they
seek to best utilize their resources in the context of responding to
traffic collisions in the city.

\subsection{Background}\label{background}}

At the end of 2017 in New York City, there were 1,923,041 cars
registered to residents of the city.
(\url{https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/10/03/car-ownership-continues-to-rise-under-mayor-de-blasio/})
This already-significant number does not include the heavy flow of
vehicles of those who visit the city or are simply passing through. By
contrast, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) budgets for a
headcount of 35,822 uniformed officers
(\url{http://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2017/03/056-NYPD.pdf}
- page 4), distributed across 77 police precincts (geographic divisions
of the city). On-duty officers/traffic enforcement agents are allocated
to each precinct to enforce traffic laws and handle emergency and
administrative response to traffic incidents (such as collisions). NYC
has been collecting traffic data, including specific data on vehicle
collisions since 2014 to support ``Vision Zero'' , a traffic safety
initiative which has the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities.

\hypertarget{objective}{%
\subsection{Objective}\label{objective}}

The objective of our analysis is to develop a supervised, prediction
model using Machine Learning techniques and the CRISP-DM framework (cite
textbook) on the available collision data to predict whether there will
be a collision in a specified police precinct at a specified time. The
intent of predicting this data is to inform the NYPD's optimal
assignment of limited officers and resources across the 77 police
precincts.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

The data set that supports this analysis is sourced from the NYC Open
Data project. The title of the data set is ``Motor Vehicle Collisions --
Crashes''. It contains entries for every collision recorded within New
York City limits by NYPD agents beginning July 1st, 2012 up to the
present day. There are approximately 1.65 million entries in the data
set.

\subsection{Initial Data Exploration and
Cleaning}\label{initial-data-exploration-and-cleaning}}

Based on what we know about the data set from the specifications at NYC
Open Data and the data dictionary, we have decided to perform some
initial cleaning steps.

Our analytics problem is to predict whether there will be a collision at
a specific time (time including a time of the day, day of the year and
calendar year). In this context, we will first look at the
``CRASH.DATE'' graph. Thinking about the scheduling of police resource,
we assume that this happens in advance, on a hour-by-hour and day-by-day
basis. We assume that resources are not scheduled on a year-by-year
basis due to uncertainty in staffing, budget, etc. We therefore examine
the data to see whether we should include the year at all. Including the
year would treat the data set as a time-series, years ranging from
2012-2020. Alternatively, we could drop the year and group all
occurrences on the same day in the same bin, possibly enhancing our
prediction.

To decide, we plot the dates and look for trends. If trends repeat
annually, we will drop the year as this trend will be preserved when we
combine. If the trend does not repeat annually (extends over the whole
range of dates) then we will not combine year as we will lose this
information when dropping year.
